# AVX

Simple experimentation with the x86\_64 AVX/AVX2 extension. Source that I am learning to learn more about the extension and its use in C: [https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/874396/Crunching-Numbers-with-AVX-and-AVX](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/874396/Crunching-Numbers-with-AVX-and-AVX).

For context, AVX is an old vector-extension for the x86\_64 instruction set (i.e. SIMD extensions). It used to perform vector operations instead of scalar ones for faster computation.
